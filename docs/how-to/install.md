# Install the plugin

## From PyPI

```bash
python -m pip install invenio-publish transpiler-mate-runtime
```

The two packages must be installed in the same Python environment. This
package registers `invenio-publish` in the `transpiler_mate.plugins`
entry-point group; the runtime supplies the `transpiler-mate` command.

Verify plugin discovery:

```console
transpiler-mate invenio-publish --help
```

## From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Transpiler-Mate/invenio-publish
cd invenio-publish
python -m pip install . transpiler-mate-runtime
```
