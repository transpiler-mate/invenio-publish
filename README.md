### Local quality checks

Install [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) and [Taskfiles](https://taskfile.dev/docs/guide) then install the Git hook:

```console
task quality:pre-commit:install
```

Every commit runs Ruff (including the configured McCabe complexity limit),
Ruff formatting, strict mypy checks, and the pytest suite.

Run the complete hook explicitly with:

```console
task quality:pre-commit:run
